# Reviewster

A performance review manager API for employees.

## Why?

Mostly a project to help learn Phoenix. I have been learning Elixir for a bit now and playing with it here and there, but wanted to build something for the web as that is my main day to day focus. So I stole the spec from an old public interview test and decided to build it out with Elixir to try a little bit of something new.

## Reqs

* PostgresQL
* Elixir

## Getting Started

* Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
* Update Postgres connection info in `config/dev.exs`
* Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
